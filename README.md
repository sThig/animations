I'm working at being a better uiux designer, part of that is being able to code in CSS.  This is my compilation (and hopefully will stop me doing a zillion repositories)

## Facebook faces

This was something I've always wanted to learn how to do.  I've learned a lot with the &:before, &:after tags as well as using calc to lay out things.  When I'm done I hope to use JS to scroll over and active them.

The link I'm using as reference (read: straight up copying but typing it out myself, no copy pasta) is [Facebook Emoji Reactions](https://codepen.io/AshBardhan/pen/dNKwXz)
